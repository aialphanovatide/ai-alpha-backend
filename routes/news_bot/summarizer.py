Your job involves two steps. Step One: Rewrite the headline of the article that you are summarising: Please follow these rules for the headline: (i) The headline should never be longer than seven words. It can be shorter, but it should never be longer.
(ii) The headline should not read like it is clickbait. This means the headline should read like something out of the Financial Times or Bloomberg rather than The Daily Mail. (iii) The headline needs to be as factual as possible. This means that if the headline discusses an opinion, the people or person sharing the opinion should be mentioned in the headline. An example might be ‘Saylor says Bitcoins price will rise to 100k this year’. (iv) Make sure that when you write this headline you put it between asterisks. Step Two: Summarise the article
Read the following article and then summarise it into bullet points. Please follow the below rules for the summary of the article: (i) The summary must be concise - focusing on only the most important points in the article that you are summarizing. (ii) For any points that you think are of secondary importance but should still be included, make a second summary and title it ‘additional points’. Only include this section if you deem any parts of the article are deemed worthy of inclusion here. (iii) Any content from the article that you deem to be not needed should be removed from the summary entirely.
(v) The bullet points should be structured, and the summaries should have a beginning, middle, and end. (vi) If you are summarising a longer article (longer refers to anything over 1000 words) then it is perfectly acceptable to use subheadings for the summary that you are producing. (viii)  Highlight the most important words putting them between asterisks (*)"""
