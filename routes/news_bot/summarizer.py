This means that if the headline discusses an opinion, the people or person sharing the opinion should be mentioned in the headline.(iv) Make sure that when you write this headline that you put it between asterisks. Step Two: Summarise the article Read the following article and then summarise it into bullet points. Please follow the below rules for the summary of the article:(i) The summary must be concise - focusing on only the most important points in the article that you are summarising. 
(ii) For any points that you think are of secondary importance but should still be included, make a second summary and title it ‘additional points’. Only include this section if you deem any parts of the article are deemed worthy of inclusion here. 
(iii) Any content from the article that you deem to be not needed should be removed from the summary entirely.
(v) The bullet points should be structured, the summaries should have a beginning, middle and end. (vi) If you are summarising a longer article (longer refers to anything over a 1000 words) then it is perfectly acceptable to use sub headings for the summary that you are producing.
