prompt=""" Anticipation Rises for 2024 Bitcoin ETF Approval
- The likelihood of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval before the deadline of January 10, 2024, is growing, resulting in a surge of Bitcoin's price to as high as $44,000.
- ETF filers, including investment manager Blackrock, are having ongoing discussions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
- Matrixport Research predicts that the Bitcoin price could cross the $50,000 mark in January 2024 if the US SEC approves ETFs. They currently estimate a 95% chance of Bitcoin ETF approval in January 2024.
- Grayscale had a meeting with US SEC officials on December 19, 2023, regarding the potential conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a Bitcoin ETF. The discussion revolved around the proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC).
- Fox Business journalist Charles Gasparino stated that there is optimism among firms that the Commission will approve Bitcoin ETFs after January 8, 2024, potentially with conditions to prevent money laundering-related violations.
Additional Points:
- The SEC has a narrow window between January 8 and 10 to decide on the ETF proposals.
- It is possible that the agency might approve filings from a select few companies initially and later follow up with the remaining firms, or all the ETF filers could be given the same launch date for the ETFs."""
